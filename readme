This project is titled An Analysis of United States Airpots Based on Location and Air Control Tower Status.
The goal of the project is to give an idea of how many airports each state has, as well as if they are large enough to 
have an air traffic control tower. After viewing the map it becomes clear that many metro areas, and states with more people,
tend to have more airports.

The project uses leaflet, font awesome, leaflet-ruler, as well as jquery, chroma, and leaflet javascript scripts. 
The custom functionality that I added to the map is a measuring tool. This tool allows you to click on any points on the map
and construct line segments that tell you how far the two points are from one another. This is ideal for measuring distances
between airpots. 

Airport data for this project is sourced from Mike Bostock (https://bost.ocks.org/mike/).
